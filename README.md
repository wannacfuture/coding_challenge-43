# Advent of Code (coding_challenge-43)


## What is Advent of Code?
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like **yes, including JavaScript and Python!!!**
> Every day for 25 days this month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree". Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.

We have created a special area for the ZTM community to share their solutions and code each day, see what others have done, and vote for your favourite solution. We even have a leaderboard!

## How to participate:
### (This event starts December 1st, 2021 but you can join anytime. Solutions submitted on the day of the puzzle reveal will receive extra points!)
1. Go to https://aoc.zerotomastery.io/ and click on the **ABOUT** to find out more about the challenge and how to participate.
2. Go to https://adventofcode.com/ and start with problem #1! Each day starting Dec 1st, 2021 a new problem will be unlocked but you have to do them in order!
3. Once you finish one puzzle/question, you can share your code and solution with the community, or check out what others in the ZTM community have done. You can even vote on your favourite solutions! You can [follow this video on how to submit your solution](https://www.loom.com/share/7310b6e83bcc4922b25023b62d173611).
4. Check out the leaderboard and see how you compare: https://aoc.zerotomastery.io/leaderboard
5. **Bonus**: In case you get stuck, I made 2 videos available for free preview for you to show you how I solve one of the problems and the steps I take. Simply go to the [Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery) course and check out the two lectures (*Exercise: Santa's Node Helper* and *Solution: Santas Node Helper*). Even if you are not enrolled in the course these two videos have the free preview option enabled... you will just have to scroll to the bottom to see them! 

**You can discuss all AOC related topics in our #coding-challenge channel on Discord!**

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
